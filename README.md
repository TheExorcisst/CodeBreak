# CodeBreak
An Interactive Game where the user has to guess the color sequence of a secret code using the GUI
This is my final submission of my CodeBreaker project. 

Altough my I have done the minimum requirement for a pass I have encountered a quite a few harsh challenges on the way. 
These Challenges meant that I was only able to make a proper start in the couple of days before the deadline. 

One of them being trouble with my computer and a few other personal issues. 

The Overall Mark I will hopefully receive is a D+ 
Due to me fullfilling the minimum requirements of the project and adding in a few extra features. 
My code is also kept to a clean grouped structure alough I have not used many methods of Classes.
